        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I was amazed by the news that under-16 vocational school students had been forced to work as cheap labor in factories as a condition for their certificates in some places in China. Their situation reminds me of a kind of fungi called Matsutake. With people's perennial and immoderate picking, many of them were destroyed when they were still immature. I hope to use Matsutake's story as a metaphor for revealing the cruelty of child labor. Thus, I design a booklet showing the 'deprived childhood' and a stop-motion animation in the format of a “black fairy tale”, and exhibited them.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">FIELD RESEARCH</h3>
        <br>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I collect some pictures and news of child labors' working and living environments. The repetitive work and dailylife broke their spirits. They were losing their hobby, getting hurt by the machine, homesiking, and losing hope for the future, and made a great tragedy.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">ANALYSIS</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Child labors are forced to work prematurely, being abused by the factory for working long times and get very little pay. Their situation reminds me of a wild fungi called Matsutake. Many of them were pulled out by acquisitive villagers when they are still immature. So I conduct in-depth research to find their similarity.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">DESIGN CONCEPT</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Based on the formal references, I want to show the process of how matsutake damaged by villagers, so I combine the visual elements collected from matsutake's and child labor's living condition and made a 'black fairy tale' animation about all of matsutake's life as a metaphor.</h4>
