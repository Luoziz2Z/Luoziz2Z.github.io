        <h3 style="color:black; font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">INSPIRATION</h3>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">When I returned to visit my elementary school Maths teacher, she told me that the first graders were learning how to add and subtract within ten by two-color flipping mini-discs as an educational tool. However, it has series of problems such as outdated teaching methods and not easy for children to hold and flip in their fingers. So I hope to design a motivational game that will change the shortcomings of the disc and make children happy in arithmetic at the same time.</h4>

        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Q1: What do you think of the learning method nowadays during the class?</h4>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">A1: The mimicry method of teaching nowadays tend to reveal problems such as inconsistent teaching progress and inconsistent classroom participation. A few children had difficulty in keeping up with the teaching progress but it's unrealistic to tutor individually in the classroom.</h4>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Q2: What ability do children need to improve at the elemantary stage?</h4>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">A2: Nowadays, children are exposed to various things, in the classroom is more lack of attention, the textbook arithmetic problems are also more boring, many times without understanding to do the problem is easy to calculate wrong.

        <h3 style="color:black; font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">This is a game designed for preschoolers as well as first graders about arithmetic education to help them consolidate and reinforce the addition and subtraction within ten. The game changes the traditional Chinese teaching mode of passive imitations and repetitive exercises, and carries out a benign competition among classmates so that triggering their reverse thinking and creativity.</h4>

        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I extract the shapes of the front, side, and top views of the two-color flipping mini-discs to create the grid of fonts, and taught the children to create their own "number babies" through participatory action research.</h4>

        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I chose the name of the first chapter of 'Addition and Subtraction' - 'Add & Sub' within Ten in the maths textbook as the name of the board game, and I tried to design the logo of the board game through the grid of round pieces.</h4>

        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Based on the drawings created by children through their imagination, I selected several popular drawing styles and recreated them digitally. After completing the initial draft, I collaborated with the children to choose their preferred versions and proceeded with printing, creating cards.</h4>

        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">1. Cards are divided into hand and calculating ones, and childs need to call out the correct equation that makes up the calculating card from the 2-3 cards in their hands.If the answer is right, go front. If it's wrong, go backward.</h4>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">2. Every time two handcards are played they need to draw same number of cards from the pile again, keeping a constant hand of 6 cards.</h4>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">3. Child who gets the first ten correct answers without mistakes win the game.</h4>
