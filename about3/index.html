        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">INSPIRATION</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I have a habit of wandering the streets, and one day when I was passing by Qipu Road, an aunty dragged me into the negative floor of the mall, and said that there were "you-know-what" luxury handbags for sale, which arouse my curiosity.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">SECONDARY RESEARCH</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">From the news reports, it's evident that both the wealthy and the poor globally are indulging in the purchase of counterfeit goods. However, they seem to overlook the chaotic supply chains behind these products, the exploited wages and time of refugees, as well as the reckless production practices that harm the environment.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">FIELD RESEARCH</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">I visited Shanghai Qipu Road Wholesale Market, and conducted a series of field research. Shoes, scarves and bags that were locked up in glass cabinets in the boutiques were randomly stacked on sofas, tucked tightly against the walls, hanging from drying racks, stuffed in plastic buckets and suitcases.</h4>

        <h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">DESIGN CONCEPT</h3>
        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Based on the preliminary researches, I found that we Chinese are pursuing the fake-brands luxury for its better quality and cost performance, while ignoring the dark trade chain and theenvironmental disruption. Therefore, I would like to put my findings in a format of a video and a book, recording the views on knockoffs, so as to understand and so as to explore the reasons for the prevalence of knockoffs.</h4>

        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Shooting Process</h4>
        <h5 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">Firstly, I pretended to be a buyer of counterfeit goods and while discussing the price with the shop owner. Then I interviewed a financial retiree, visited her home and learnt many about the fake chain. Finally, I spoke to a newly employed school teacher about how her quest for luxury goods had reached the moonlight clan.</h5>
