        <h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">This is a story about my inner self. I remember the loneliest and most confusing times in my life when stayed alone in my room, and the balcony window became my only friend. Imagined myself floating in the air, like a lonely planet, I'm going through the same routine every day. While one afternoon, I heard children laughing from the nearby school. Their happiness brought me a simple but deep joy. So I transformed my experiences into a poem, hoping to inspire anyone feeling lonely to find their own source of little happiness in life.</h4>
