<h3 style="font-weight: 700;line-height: 1.25;text-align: left;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h4 style="font-weight: 500;line-height: 1.3;text-align: left;">This project is originated from the over-packaging and exaggerated advertising of the avocado industry, which has changed popular perception of avocados from common fruits to healthy and even diet products. So I wonder how advertising over-package common fruits, I would like to make a satiric brand called 'Tomate' to advocate reproductive health and sexual harmony to change the world's perception toward tomatoes from fresh fruit to sex and fertility product, and reflect the exaggerated and unscientific marketing methods.</h4>
